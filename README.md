The best way to try out the Adobe Client Data Layer is to install the distributed npm package in your project build, by running:
```
npm install @adobe/adobe-client-data-layer@beta
```

Locate the `/dist` folder in the installed package, which contains the built and minified javascript.

This script can then be included in your page head, as follows:

```html
<script src="adobe-client-data-layer.min.js" async defer></script>
```

## Building / Testing

First run the following commands:
```
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
```   
 
Then choose from the following gulp tasks:
* `gulp` - run the tests, generates the build in the `./dist` folder and runs a development server on `localhost:3000`.
* `gulp build` - run the tests and generates the build in the `./dist` folder.
* `gulp test` - run the unit tests
