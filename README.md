The Adobe Client Data Layer aims to reduce the effort to instrument websites by providing a standardized method to expose and access any kind of data for any script.

## Documentation

* [Adobe Client Data Layer](https://github.com/adobe/adobe-client-data-layer/wiki)

## Consuming

The best way to try out the Adobe Client Data Layer is to install the distributed npm package in your project build, by running:
```
npm install @adobe/adobe-client-data-layer
```

Locate the `/dist` folder in the installed package, which contains the built and minified javascript.

This script can then be included in your page head, as follows:

```html
<script src="adobe-client-data-layer.min.js" async defer></script>
```

## Building / Testing

First run the following commands:
```
npm install
```   
 
Then choose from the following npm scripts:
* `npm run dev` - run the tests, generates the build in the `./dist` folder and runs a development server on `localhost:3000`.
* `npm run build` - run the tests and generates the build in the `./dist` folder.
* `npm run test` - run the unit tests

Note: you can [get some stats](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@adobe/adobe-client-data-layer@1.0.0-beta.3) (bundle size, download time) about the released version.
